# Abstract
“The relationship between the stress and strain that a particular material displays is known as that
particular material's stress–strain curve.” [1] The strain on fresh muscle increases as more stress is
applied to it. A loading experiment can be performed to determine these values for any given
muscle. These values can then be used and evaluated using the fundamental relationship for soft
tissue. By using many computational methods, we can use this data to make analytic curves that
closely resemble that of the original.
